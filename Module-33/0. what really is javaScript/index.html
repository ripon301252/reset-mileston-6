        // Q. what is javaScript?
            // A.1: JavaScript is a highly abstracted programming language.
            // A.2: JavaScript is a JIT compiled language.

        // Q. what high abstraction?
            // A.1: hiding the implementation details. Example: ATM machine.
            // A.2: showing only the functionality to the users

        // Q. what is Garbage Collection?
            // A. automatically Garbage Collection & delete. (Garbage = Aborjona)

        // Q.  what is JIT ?  (JIT as a like: Apple);
            // A. Just-In-Time. (interpretation)

        // Q. what is compiled ? (compiled as a like: Laau or kodu) (compiled = sonkolito).
            // A. Just-In-Time compiler converts the entire code into machine code execute them immediately.
